      <p class="about-intro">
        Sri Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, stands as one of India’s
        oldest living temples. With a history spanning more than a millennium,
        it remains the spiritual heart of Hampi, Karnataka. Its rich culture,
        architecture, and traditions continue to attract devotees and visitors
        from all over the world.The temple began as a small 7th-century shrine
        on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Over time, under the Chalukyas,
        Hoysalas, and especially the Vijayanagara Empire, it expanded into the
        magnificent complex seen today. The towering gopuram, carved stone
        pillars, mandapas, and inner sanctum reflect classical Dravidian
        architecture. Even after Hampi’s destruction in 1565, Virupaksha Temple
        remained untouched and continued regular worship — making it unique
        among the monuments of the region. Today, it remains active with daily
        rituals and grand festivals like Rathotsava, Pampa Festival, and Maha
        Shivaratri, drawing thousands of devotees every year. Recognized as part
        of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hampi, Virupaksha Temple stands not
        only as a monument of history but also as a symbol of living heritage,
        devotion, and timeless Indian culture.

        <h2>Origins & Sacred Significance</h2>
        <p>
          The temple’s origin dates back to the 7th century as a small shrine on
          the banks of the Tungabhadra River. It grew into a major pilgrimage
          centre dedicated to Lord Virupaksha, considered the consort of Goddess
          Pampa. The sanctuary existed well before the founding of the
          Vijayanagara capital, and ancient inscriptions of the 9th–10th century
          refer to Shiva worship on this site.

          <p>
            According to epigraphical and archaeological evidence, the initial
            shrine was expanded under the Chalukya and Hoysala dynasties, though
            the majority of the existing temple complex is attributed to the
            Vijayanagara period. Despite the destruction of the city in 1565,
            the temple remained intact and worship has continued without
            interruption — making it one of the few ancient temples in India
            still active since its inception.

        <h2>Vijayanagara Empire Expansion</h2>
        <p>
          Under the Vijayanagara Empire (1336–1565 CE), the temple complex was
          significantly expanded by the rulers, including Krishnadevaraya. The
          majestic eastern gopuram, pillared halls and cloisters were added,
          transforming the temple into the magnificent monument observed today.
        </p>

        <div class="more-text">
          <p>
            The nine-tiered eastern gateway rises to about 50 metres, anchoring
            the outer court. According to inscriptions, King Krishnadevaraya
            commissioned the central pillared hall in 1510 CE, enabling the
            temple to host royal ceremonies, music, dance and festivals. The
            expansion deeply reflects the empire’s devotion and architectural
            ambition.

        <h2>Architectural Marvel</h2>
        <p>
          The temple is a striking example of Dravidian architecture featuring
          soaring gopurams, intricately carved pillars and stone corridors. Its
          design even incorporates fractal-like patterns and a mathematical
          precision seldom seen in ancient structures.
        </p>

        <button class="read-btn">Read More</button>

        <div class="more-text">
          <p>
            One of the most striking features is the usage of repeated patterns
            that suggest fractal geometry. The sacred complex includes the
            Manmatha tank and a small channel of the Tungabhadra flowing through
            the temple terrace, enhancing both ritual significance and aesthetic
            harmony.

        <h2>Major Festivals</h2>
        <p>
          The temple hosts many important festivals including the annual car
          festival (Rathotsava), Pampa Festival and Maha Shivaratri, attracting
          thousands of devotees from across India.

          <p>
            The Rathotsava involves pulling a grand wooden chariot through the
            streets of Hampi. On Pampa Festival the temple shines with lamps and
            musical programmes honouring Goddess Pampa. During Maha Shivaratri
            devotees fast, chant through the night and witness the grand
            abhisheka rituals at the lingam.

            Despite the destruction of the Vijayanagara capital, Sri Virupaksha
            Temple was never abandoned. It remains an active temple and draws
            pilgrimage and tourism alike. Its status as a living heritage site
